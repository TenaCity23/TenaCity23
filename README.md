### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is An Nguyen and I am a Computer Engineering student at San Jose State University. I am also a Cybersecurity Enthusiast and I am always looking forward to learning new skills. In my repositories section, you'll be able to find my portfolio for each of the programming languages I've learned.

Here are links to my repositories: 
* [C++](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP)
* [C Programming](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming)

I have also had a chance to collaborate in creating an Online Food Store website with my classmates, which can be found through this link: [OFS Website](https://github.com/venajustin/OnlineFoodStore)
