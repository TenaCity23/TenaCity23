### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is An Nguyen and I am a computer engineer student at San Jose State University. I am a Cybersecurity Enthusiast and I am always looking forward to learning new skills. In my repositories section, you'll be able to find my portfolio for each of the programming languages I've learned. My main language to code right now is C++, but I'm always updating the repositories as I am continuing to practice and hone my skills. 

Here are links to my repositories: 
* [C++](https://github.com/TenaCity23/CPP)
* [C Programming](https://github.com/TenaCity23/c_programming)
